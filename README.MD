  ## Description

  A command-line Content Management System (CMS) that allows a user to view and edit employees, roles or departments. This is intended for a company who wants to track their employees and have access to viewing and managing employee roles or departments.
  
  Each employee has an ID based on when they were entered into the system, a first and last name, a role, a department which corresponds with the role, a salary based on their role, and a manager if needed.

  While creating this app, I used Node.js to run the inquirer module to prompt questions, while using MySQL to handle the database and console.table module to display data in tables in the command-line interface.
